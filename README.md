# Implementation of a Server That Comports With the HTTP 1.1 Secification

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JamesChristie/http-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JamesChristie/http-server)

Or rather: a computer-based method of making electrical signals travel in insignificantly different patterns with the hope that the arbitrary abstractions that are drawn from them help make the world seem like less of a cold, lightless hellscape.

## Usage

### Setup: Hello darkness, my old friend.

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JamesChristie/http-server.git
```

#### Package the Application

It is upon this piecemeal simulacrum that we place our hopes and dreams. May it shamble forth to reach it goal over the distant sounds of wailing and gnashing of teeth behind it.

```bash
mvn package
```

This should produce a `http-server-<VERSION>-SNAPSHOT.jar` file in the `target/` directory of the application.

### Operation: Behold, as a wild ass in the desert go I forth to my work.

Run the jar file. There will eventually be more here, but it's pretty straightforward for now.
